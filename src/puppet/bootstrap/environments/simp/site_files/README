This directory houses SIMP-specific files that may be auto-generated at
runtime.

Please take care when modifying anything in this directory as it may severely
impact your system!

The purpose of this is to eliminate all dynamic materials from the main SIMP
repo so that users can easily manage their systems with r10k.
